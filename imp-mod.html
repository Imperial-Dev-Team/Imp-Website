        An official Imperial mod is very much needed, - in game cooperation and communication is key
        <br>
        <br>
        the idea emerged when I was trying to memorize the list of blacklisted/wanted players, I thought it would be better if we have a mod made which alerts us when a blacklisted player comes in render distance.
        <br>
        <br>
        However a lot of nice haves could be added to this mod, which would make communication and cooperation much efficient and better
        <br>
        <br>
        1. as I stated above, blacklisted/wanted players should be highlighted, It wouldn't be good if i became friends with them, offered them gear and let them go, just because i/you didn't remember their names. being blacklisted by the Imperials should be a real consequence, not an empty threat(A kid today threatened to leak our bases on Reddit if we didn't include him in the group, we've blacklisted him but how long will we remember his name?)
        <br>
        <br>
        1a. a nice to have here would be that players on the main or branch discord get alerted when a blacklisted player comes into view of a player, so everyone knows where that wanted player is.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. names/IGN of group members and allied groups should be highlighted and rank displayed, we might end up killing one of us/them by mistake. this would even prevent players scamming members by telling they belong to Imperials when they don't 2a) Nice to have would be that when together(like pvp'ing) everyone is light blue wearing diamond armor, it decreases reaction times reading name tags and differentiating enemies, if teammates were highlighted a different color like red, it would be better
        <br>
        <br>
        3. a very important point would be that only Imperials should be able to use this, we don't want other groups exploiting this to find where Imperial players are. a suggestion would be that to use the mod/API to get the list of players, the member would need to enter a generated token, the token would either be generated using a discord bot or logging in to a website,
        <br>
        <br>
        3a. high ranking players should be be able to disable certain functionalities of low ranking non-trusted players. so if he/she doesn't want low ranking players to know where Imperial players are, then F.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. whenever an enderchest/valuable stashes is in render distance of a Imperial player it should be logged and updated to a server, this would create a database of where these important items are, so if Suppose another Imperial player needs them, he knows where to find enderchests/stashes, it should be included in the mod, so nearest known enderchests/stashes are shown on a click of a button. this would be incredibly useful near spawn or when a war is going on, People wouldn't need to DM and ask everyone on where enderchests/stashes are. 4a) this information should also be only be available to certain trusted players, but data is collected from everybody(ofc we should have the option to opt out). 4b) other items of significance like bases, should also be available.
        <br>
        <br>
        5. dont know if this is doable: Many times, when writing sensitive information in chat, like base coords etc, we might write it in public chat by mistake, also many servers, do not have the party chat feature, it would be nice to just "/imp 'message'" and the mod automatically DMs Imperial members, so that members can easily chat with each other without opening discord.
        <br>
        <br>
        6. when a Imperial member logs into a server that has an active branch, ongoing activites, like base builds, events(spawn events, christmas events), wars will be listed above, decided by the branch.
        <br>
        <br>
        7. fun feature: like in some clients, when i kill a person or do something, it writes in chat, "aaaa killed bbbb with xxx client". if I enable this fun feature, if i kill a player, it writes in chat "Imperial member aaaa killed bbbb" or something similar, much better sounding. (basically AutoEZ)
